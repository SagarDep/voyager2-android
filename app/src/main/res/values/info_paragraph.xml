            <p>&bull; NOTE: The app is developed for learning purpose. It is an open source project published on GitHub and has not
                been tested for production usage. If you are looking for a more stable/usable version, please check out the app
                 "Voyager: Route Planner".
            </p>

            <p>&bull; Voyager 2 calculates the optimal (shortest) route for visiting all entered stop points.
            </p>
            <p>&bull; Optimal route calculation is NOT done based on data from the Google directions service.
                It simply uses the direct distance between two stops (by the Haversine algorithm) and no traffic condition
                is taken into account.
            </p>

            <p>&bull; We canâ€™t use the Google directions service to do the calculation because the API is
                not free for this new Android app.
            </p>

            <p>&bull; Note: Please use the auto-complete feature while entering addresses. The app only recognizes
                addresses entered via auto-complete.
                <br>
                <br>

                The auto-complete feature is provided by Google Maps API. If it does not work properly, there are three
                possibilities: 1.The Internet connection is currently not good; 2.The Google Maps API service is currently
                not working properly; 3.The Google Maps API service (not the actual Google Maps app) has some compatibility
                issues with your device. For any of the above issues, I can not do anything about it, sorry :(
