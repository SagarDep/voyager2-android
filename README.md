# Voyager v2

## Getting Started

1. Open IntelliJ
2. Import Project
3. Import project from external model -> Gradle
4. Use defaults

## Notes

1. ButterKnife is used extensively, and unfortunately that requires proper handling of unbinding. To ease this a little, there are helper base classes in the ioc package.
